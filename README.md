# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

A Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator inspired by the beautiful design concept from [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). Itâ€™s a multi-screen app with a sleek UI, custom styling, and intuitive functionality.

## Features & What I Learned

- Implementing Flutter themes to create a consistent and visually appealing design.
- Navigating between multiple screens using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- Extracting and refactoring widgets efficiently for better code organization.
- Passing functions as parameters and fields for flexible UI interaction.
- Using the GestureDetector widget to enhance user interaction beyond basic taps.
- Integrating custom color palettes using hex codes for a polished look.
- Customizing Flutter widgets to match a specific design aesthetic.
- Utilizing Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator for cleaner logic.
- Understanding composition vs. inheritance and following Flutter's UI-building best practices.
- Differentiating between `const` and `final` in Dart and knowing when to use each.

This project helped me refine my Flutter skills and explore advanced UI/UX techniques.
